# ctjhoa dotfiles
This is my personal configuration files.
I don't like fancy configuration it's KISS.

No preview for the moment (but soon)

# Installation
Create links with install.sh scripts
(beware it will erase old config files)

## X11
Login manager is for loosers. Start X from tty.

## Zsh
Just some files for X.
Otherwise use the grml config.

## Xresources
Bohemiath color config is mime.
Inspired from the two others colors files (authors: jasonwryan and kori)

## Requirements
